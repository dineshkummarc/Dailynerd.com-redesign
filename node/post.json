[{"title":"New bloging engine.","blurb":"So I finally got around to updating the blogging engine and the website. There are a few minor improvements as well as a new redesign. ","body":"First I added an automatic poster. so now I don't need to go through a huge hastle to update the site. \n\nSecond I made the templating client side. This is a much needed improvment over the old method that did all of that work server side. Now its just bare bones updates from here on out. You get some html once and your done. Cache it and all you ever do from there on out is download posts. (granted posts don't cache so I'll chuck that on my todo list.\n\nAlso all of the cool browser bar stuff from the first engine is gone. There's also no more searching. Ill fix that later.","tags":"","time":1332487876118},{"title":"Speeding up mobile (notes)","blurb":"For the past while I've been thinking on how to speed up mobile websites. These are some notes that I have to make mobile web faster. ","body":"<h4> Cache Ajax </h4>\nWhen loading a site it may be useful to cache the Ajax response to html5 local storage. This allows the page to load old content before new content is delivered  resulting in perceived speed improvement (although not an actual speed improvent as we now have to pull from storage before we display new stuff). My current temptation is to start an Ajax request, THEN load cache and finally display what ever we get from the server. \n\nSo far that's all I got. My next thoughts are on how to decrease the latenency between the server and the phone. All that stuff the carriers put in to get the phone to go online ends up adding some odd 300ms to the round-trip time. If i can start the Ajax request early i can get a responce and render it as soon as the phone is ready rather than requesting after we have already rendered.  \n\nMore on this later.\n-Nick ","tags":"","time":1332537754846}]
