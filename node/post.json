[{"title":"New bloging engine.","blurb":"So I finally got around to updating the blogging engine and the website. There are a few minor improvements as well as a new redesign. ","body":"First I added an automatic poster. so now I don't need to go through a huge hastle to update the site. \n\nSecond I made the templating client side. This is a much needed improvment over the old method that did all of that work server side. Now its just bare bones updates from here on out. You get some html once and your done. Cache it and all you ever do from there on out is download posts. (granted posts don't cache so I'll chuck that on my todo list.\n\nAlso all of the cool browser bar stuff from the first engine is gone. There's also no more searching. Ill fix that later.","tags":"","time":1332487876118}]
