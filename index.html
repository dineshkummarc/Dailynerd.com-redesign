<h1>Proposition Infinity</h1>
<p>Bender, we're trying our best. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex.
Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Oh, I always feared
he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
<h2>A Fishful of Dollars</h2>
<p>But existing is basically all I do! But existing is basically all I do! Well, thanks
to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my
lust for violence? Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>
<ul>
<li>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</li>
<li>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his
legs?</li>
<li>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</li>
</ul>
<h3>That Darn Katz!</h3>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Now what? No! I
want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
<h4>The Honking</h4>
<p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I
found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. That could be 'my' beautiful soul
sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are you, my warranty?!</li>
<li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li>
<li>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect
its brain!</li>
</ol>
<h5>How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back</h5>
<p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps
gifts! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your
opinions manually! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Michelle, I don't
regret this, but I both rue and lament it. You are the last hope of the universe. I'll
get my kit!</p>
<h6>The 30% Iron Chef</h6>
<p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Wow! A superpowers drug you can
just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the
charge and the reception isn't very&hellip; Yeah. Give a little credit to our public
schools. Daylight and everything. And I'm his friend Jesus.</p>
<p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at
it? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as
if you were actually wriggling through them. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to

Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Take me to your
leader!</p>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. So I really am
important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? You are the last hope of the universe.
Who are you, my warranty?! Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</p>
<p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. We're also Santa Claus! Oh, I always
feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Hey, whatcha
watching? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Tell her you just want to talk.
It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
<p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. As an interesting side note, as a
head without a body, I envy the dead. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? And
yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Shut up and
take my money! Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</p>
<p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Of all the friends I've had&hellip;
you're the first. And I'm his friend Jesus. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
<p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to
play this stupid thing. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Leela's gonna kill me. Why would a
robot need to drink? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship.
Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
<p>But existing is basically all I do! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue
and lament it. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
Why would I want to know that?</p>
<p>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Ummm&hellip;to eBay? For example, if you
killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! You lived before you met me?!</p>
<p>I love you, buddy! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go&hellip; look for more
stuff to steal! Soothe us with sweet lies. I guess if you want children beaten, you
have to do it yourself. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do
things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Yes, if you make it

done anything at all.</p>
<p>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? You
mean while I'm sleeping in it? I never loved you. My fellow Earthicans, as I have
explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter
and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark
wizards. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze
that those things bring.</p>
<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm
now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
No, just a regular mistake.</p>
<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated
poopers. You lived before you met me?!</p>
<p>Kif might! Kif might! But existing is basically all I do! They're like sex, except
I'm having them!</p>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Isn't it
true that you have been paid for your testimony? There's one way and only one way to
determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
