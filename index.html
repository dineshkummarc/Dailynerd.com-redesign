<h1>The Duh-Vinci Code</h1>
<p>Hey, whatcha watching? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy
the dead. We're also Santa Claus! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How
dare you lie in front of Jesus? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your
skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Isn't it true that you
have been paid for your testimony?</p>
<h2>Hell Is Other Robots</h2>
<p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yes, if you make it look
like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done
anything at all. Leela's gonna kill me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</li>
<li>Kif might!</li>
<li>Who am I making this out to?</li>
<li>Hey, whatcha watching?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesser of Two Evils</h3>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. I found what I
need. And it's not friends, it's things. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public
schools. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</p>
<h4>That Darn Katz!</h4>
<p>Who are you, my warranty?! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book
'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of
Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Kif
might!</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are you, my warranty?!</li>
<li>Ummm&hellip;to eBay?</li>
<li>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Obsoletely Fabulous</h5>
<p>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Bender, we're trying our best. You are
the last hope of the universe. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who
isn't bound and gagged. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to
exist! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels
as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
